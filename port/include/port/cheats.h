/* Debug cheats for testing (the overlay's Debug page, "Cheats for testing"; game/cheats.c): things a new
   character does not have yet, for testing the menus, the magic and later areas. Each is a one-off
   change to the game's state: it lasts as any progress does, and is kept by a save made after it.

   The overlay asks (port_cheat_request); the game takes the request in play, at the end of a frame
   (Quick_PollGame), so nothing changes under a menu being built or a frame being drawn. */
