/* Quick saves (port/platform/quicksave.c, game/quicksave.c): the game's progress in the game's own save
   format, taken anywhere in play and loaded through the game's own load path, so any build of the
   program can read them (save states, port/include/port/savestate.h, load only in the build that
   made them).

   A quick save is the image Game_WriteSaveImage writes for a memory card save (it holds the map, the
   player's position, heading and look, HP and MP, the stats, the items, the flags of the world), with
   a small PC header. Loading puts that image where a memory card load puts it and leaves the game's
   main loop as a card load does, so the game restarts the session from it (GameLoop_ResetSystems,
   GameLoop_Run on the saved map). No memory card is read or written either way. */
