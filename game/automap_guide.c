/* automap_guide.c: PC-only. What the automap (game/automap.c, docs/port/AUTOMAP.md) says that the game's data
   does not: the creatures' names, and hand-written guide notes for locks, puzzles and odd objects. The map's
   cheats stand in for an online guide, so these tables grow as the game is played through; everything else
   the map shows comes from the player's disc and the game's memory as it runs.

   - Creatures: the game names no monster anywhere in its data. These are the names of Prima's official
     strategy guide (2004) as the community's creature list has them (cleanhit.wiki, KF4:Creatures), placed on
     the chr.prm records by hit points, experience, resistances and drops (decomp/docs/GAME_DATA.md,
     "Monsters"; the decomp's enemy/*.c files carry the same names). A record not listed shows as
     "Creature (#record)".
   - Hints: by map and map object (its index in the map's object list, the map file's order: the same every
     visit; the full map's hover label shows it with the hints cheat, e.g. "#45"), or by map and entity spawn
     (the spawn record's index, "spawn #8"). Shown with the hints cheat. Write what the player needs to know,
     not the game's text. */
