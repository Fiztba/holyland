/* draw_distance.c: PC-only. The game's side of --draw-distance (port_draw_distance(),
   port/include/port/host.h).

   What ends the view. func_00112BD0 picks the map records to draw each frame by a half-plane behind
   the player and the visibility table of the record the player stands on (Map_TestFlagBlockBit); the
   map header's draw distance (0x7C) would cut by distance as well, but it is 0 in all 64 maps. The
   objects, entities and items are drawn on the records drawn, with no distance cut of their own. The
   projection's far plane (GameLoop_SetCameraMatrices: 65535, Z 0 at about 70,000) lies beyond what the
   fog leaves. So what ends the view is the fog.

   The fog: a model's fog block (MapFogBlockValues, VU1 0x3C) gives the GS's fog value as
   near + far / w (w the distance along the view, clamped to 0..255, 255 no fog), so the same fog k
   times as far, f(w / k), is near + k * far / w: only the far term is scaled. A block of constant fog
   (far 0: a tint) stays as it is. The game copies each map's blocks into map_draw_state every frame
   (func_00112BD0), and the models point into that copy, so the copy is where they are scaled; the
   current block (map_draw_state.current_fog_block) fades towards the copy's over 30 frames, so a change
   of the switch in play eases in. With the fog further, the far plane moves out with it.

   The sky: the map records that follow the player (flags bit 31: a dome or backdrop at a fixed distance
   around the player) keep the PS2's fog unless port_draw_distance_sky(): pushing their fog out does not
   show anything further away, it only lightens the sky (map 000's dark sky shows its clouds). */
